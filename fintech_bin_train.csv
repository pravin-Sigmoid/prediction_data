The significance of this number is incorporated into our shield and serves to remind us that the Bank will always hold true to its core values of customer-oriented banking.

UNB has seen many changes over the years including a devastating fire, which occurred on July 4, 1993 totally destroying the original landmark structure. The determination of both directors and employees, as well as their overall dedication to the Mount Carmel area were the forces behind a grand reconstruction and rededication of the building in December 1994. UNB is more than just bricks and mortar, it is an institution that has stood the test of time, through good times and through bad there has always been UNB.

With lower fees and competitive rates; UNB is proud to call itself your hometown bank. Let UNB show you what old-fashioned, customer-oriented hometown banking is all about.

We believe health care should be readily available to all, regardless of socioeconomic standing. Our mission is to ensure our solutions maximize the use of readily available resources such as ambient light and personal devices such as mobile phones and tablets. This leads to greatly reduced costs, vastly increased ease of use and rapid global deployment. Environmentally, our impact footprint is zero as our technology does not generate any harmful radiation. Miznee has launched a pioneering digital healthcare marketplace for buyers and vendors of digital healthcare. We have developed and provided three highly innovative digital health assessment and therapy tools for vendors such as healthcare providers to use to deliver digital healthcare services. The tools enable highly personalized and AI driven digital self-assessment and therapy from physical to psychological health concerns. Any language and media content support is included.

Most simply don't bother because there is no viable solution being offered. A simple, easy-to-use skin beauty monitoring is needed. If the consumer can see beneath the thin top skin layer, they can get a heads-up on upcoming or underlying skin issue. Miznee Subskin Imaging now provides that solution via the consumer's smartphone, with no external hardware attachment. With a membership account, the consumer opens the Miznee app and takes a snapshot of the affected skin area (face or any other body area). The subskin of the skin area is shown along with simple graphical and texture analytics. The consumer can monitor their skin as often as they wish in the convenience and privacy of their home or anywhere else. They can also share the images with their beauty consultant for advice.",0

2948,"Cyber security has grown old and is ready for disruption. Two key questions come to mind on any organization when it comes to cyber security. First, how vulnerable are we against attacks from professional hackers and script kiddies? Second, what must we do to stay safe? Two important questions. 60% of med-sized businesses experienced a cyber-attack in 2018. Of those attacks, 4 in 5 evade antivirus software. Yet, the majority of medium-sized businesses rely on anti-virus, firewalls and Windows policies like requiring a password. This is clearly not sufficient. Cyber risks are correlated; you cannot separate a vulnerable laptop from the employee or the credentials that are out there on the dark web. Hackers exploit a weakness in a user to get a foothold on a laptop in order to get access to confidential data. For this reason: we believe that to protect an organization, a holistic approach is required. An approach that focusses on employee, websites, devices and organization. The CISO or CTO should have a quick answer to basic clients. For example: How much effort does it take a hacker to breach us? What is the risk of ransomware attacks? What data of our company has been exposed to criminals? How do we perform compared to peers? Skopos helps to answer these questions in real time. We detect the weakest link in your chain by smart pairing of humans and machines. Skopos is the future of cyber security",0

Headquartered in Malaysia, the Group has been in the financial services industry since 1968 through Hong Leong Finance Berhad and since 1982 through Dao Heng BankLtd. in Hong Kong. Dao Heng Bank Ltd. has since been sold to another banking institution.
Hong Leong Bank started its humble beginning in 1905 in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia under the name of Kwong Lee Mortgage and Remittance Company and later in 1934, incorporated as Kwong Lee Bank Ltd.. In 1989, it was renamed MUI Bank, operating in 35 branches. In January 1994, the Group acquired MUI Bank through Hong Leong Credit Berhad (now known as Hong Leong Financial Group Berhad). This milestone saw the birth of Hong Leong Bank and in October the same year, Hong Leong Bank was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as Bursa Malaysia).

In 2004, the finance company business of Hong Leong Finance Berhad was acquired by Hong Leong Bank. With more than 100 years of banking knowledge and experience, Hong Leong Bank today has a strong heritage, leading market positions and a well-recognised business franchise and brand.

In 2011, Hong Leong Bank completed the merger with EON Bank Group. The merger effectively transforms the Bank into a banking group of more than RM145 billion in assets and an expanded network of 329 branches nationwide. With an extensive distribution network of over 300 branches, sales and business centres in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Cambodia along with a comprehensive range of alternate and electronic channels including self service terminals, Hong Leong Call Centre, Hong Leong Online Banking and Hong Leong Mobile Banking , Hong Leong Bank reaches out to its customers in all of the communities in which it operates. Following its commitment to stay relevant, Hong Leong Bank also launched Mach by Hong Leong Bank in 2012, a sub-brand that brings together “bricks and clicks” to offer a range of life starter products and services targeted to meet the needs of the Gen-Y community.

Reaching out beyond the shores of Malaysia, in 2008, Hong Leong Bank was the first Malaysian bank to enter the Chinese banking sector with a 20% strategic shareholding in Bank of Chengdu Co., Ltd. In December of the same year, Hong Leong Bank became the first and only Malaysian and Southeast Asian bank to be granted a license to incorporate and operate a 100% wholly-owned commercial bank in Vietnam. In 2013, Hong Leong Bank proudly launched its 100% wholly-owned commercial bank in Cambodia. The Bank has also established a representative office in Nanjing in February 2014.

Hong Leong Group Malaysia is one of the largest business groups in Malaysia and internationally. The strong foundation and solid growth of the Group is attributed to the Power of Vision - the Vision of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan. Today, the Vision is manifested and entrenched in the Group's corporate culture, which is firmly rooted on the Group's core values of Quality, Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Honour, Human Resource, Unity, Progress and Social Responsibility.

The Group's ""Reaching Out to You"" embeds the organisation in the country and community within which it operates. Through its financial services arm Hong Leong Financial Group Berhad, which consists of Hong Leong Bank, Hong Leong Assurance and Hong Leong Investment Bank, the Group is well positioned as an integrated financial services provider.",1

By eliminating the skill gap, Software Sales University creates a place where students and professionals can secure their career in software sales. It's unique because the university is entirely dedicated to software sales skills like vetting, open calling, qualifying, demonstrating value and closing rather than deal support skills like the SDR role. It's special because students actually learn the capabilities that account executives use to make their money and start applying these concepts to advance their software sales career. The big benefit is that it helps students and professionals define a path to building a career in software sales rather than simply pursuing the SDR route. This helps them avoid interviewing for a job having never done the actual work. Software Sales University makes it easy for students and professionals to learn software sales skills in order to build a career in technology sales or launch their own tech startup.

The system is dynamically adapting to patients' needs with machine learning algorithms. 3.

The health systems in many EU countries can provide reasonably good health services, but usually only at the beginning during primary rehabilitation. The huge gap in care occurs when patients return home. Lack of neuropsychologists makes further rehabilitation very limited to private treatment. The aging population leads to a higher number of strokes and the problem will be more concerning in the coming years.

The embedding of Project M helps doctors better understand the emotional state of their patients in real-time, thus maximizing more accurate diagnoses. Project M uses NVIDIA Clara Guardian to assist in its emotional health facial recognition software. With the help of NVIDIA, Project M is able to provide highly accurate and helpful patient information to healthcare professionals leading to better emotional consciousness.   Our next model is Project M backed e-learning system - using the comprehensive emotional analysis Project M provides (including levels of happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, neutrality, contempt, and fear along with moods such as positive, negative, and neutral), instructors can accurately gauge whether students are actively paying attention and can take personalised measures to address each students’ needs. With M’s feedback, teachers will thus be able to improve the teaching and learning process more efficiently.    Project M won first place at the Texas Children's Hospital Healthcare Hackathon, one of the top-ranked children’s hospitals in the US and successfully completed the three-month AI Tech Sprint at the Department of Veterans Affairs 2020-2021 where we developed a solution for our heroes - veterans.

The initial diseases that Pleiogenix is targeting are acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH), COVID-19, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) / Fibrosis, with additional diseases to follow. AAH is a deadly liver disease resulting in mortality in most patients within 6 months, in the absence of a liver transplant. NASH is a severe form of the chronic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The AAH market is estimated to be $575 million by 2023, while the NASH market is estimated to be $35-40 billion by 2025. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; there have been over 10 million cases resulting in ~500,000 deaths (globally). There are no approved therapeutics that prevent or treat AAH, NASH, or COVID-19. Pleiogenix has identified a Phase 2A-ready drug candidate, PLG888, an orally available, pan-PPAR agonist (non-thiazolidinedione) that increases circulating adiponectin without eliciting body weight gain or edema. Adiponectin is a hormone possessing significant anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and metabolic clinical benefits. In patients suffering from AAH, NASH, and COVID-19, inflammation is severely increased, and adiponectin is reduced in patients with NASH. Increased adiponectin is linked to decreased systemic inflammation, increased hepatic fat oxidation, decreased hepatic fibrosis, and amelioration of NASH. Thus, PLG888 has the potential to become the first prescription pharmaceutical for AAH, NASH / fibrosis, and/or COVID-19.",0

We are the only music licensing platform in the world to allow instant licensing of recording artists. By removing all obstacles associated with licensing of recording artists, we create instant access to a new source of music that has been largely untapped so far because of the length and complexity of the licensing process.  It's an evolution from online royalty-free music libraries and a great alternative to custom music.  Creatives can quickly find ad-friendly music from trending artists, music that drives the emotional bond with an audience which only real music can do. All of our tracks have been curated so creative teams won't lose time listening to music that could not be used for brand content. Producers love how fast and simple it is to license our music. We turned what used to be, on average, a four-week process into instant licensing. And since all of our tracks are E&O insured, production teams don’t need to worry about using them.  Up-and-coming artists finally have access to a new source of potential revenue. And since each track gets priced individually based on their reputation and the license terms, they also get paid fairly for the use of their work. it's called equitable music. It's truly a win-win for all parties unlike other alternatives out there. And with brands becoming more and more socially responsible and ad agencies always on the lookout for better music for their spots, the appetite for our offering is phenomenal.",0

1059,"If you have or are starting a business in 2021, most likely your business is designed around convenience. Most likely your business is going to bring your products and services to your customers doorstep. However, straight away you’re faced with a complex problem… should you develop an expensive software solution or, do you use what’s on the shelf and put the extra time and resources into growing your core business idea? Unfortunately, what’s on the shelf won’t give you a competitive advantage against the larger companies that have hand built their own solution. Without a custom solution you simply won’t be efficient enough to survive in the long term. This is where fieldd comes in! Fieldd powers your mobile services that travel to your customer’s home or work, and does so in a way that gives your customers the impression that you have hand built your own custom solution. Fieldd is different to other platforms because fieldd focuses on automating and prioritizing the customer experience. From the moment your customers book your services online, they are guided through a unique customer experience to turn them into a customer for life. Other platforms simply hold your customers’ details and often are no better than an address book. This unique “loop” to keep your customers engaged isn’t possible on other platforms and companies are forced to use a range of solutions to get the job done. Why hasn’t this been done before? Put simply, building fieldd has been a hard process! After 3 years of initial R&D & 30,000+ live R&D bookings, fieldd was launched in 2019 and now is the software of choice in 15 countries across 20 different industries. 15 years ago the thought of McDonald’s delivering your food was a futuristic thought. Today with the latest technology, UberEats has made this idea an everyday solution. 15 years ago the thought of catching a taxi was also not an everyday solution due to the inconvenience of booking, tracking & paying for your taxi. Yet today, technology has pushed taxis to become an everyday solution. The demand for customer convenience has always been on the rise and with COVID, this need has been supercharged even further. 100% of the time customers will instantly book the best priced, fastest service provider to come to them. Yet 98% of businesses rely on a 15 year old quote request form with a 1-5 day reply time. Before Uber entered the taxi & food industry, these two industries represented industries that were waiting to be optimized with technology. The amount of other service industries that are currently highly inconvenient and can be optimized, is practically endless. Prior to fieldd, the automation and customization within fieldd that are included with every plan, were only possible with custom software development. Now, it’s possible with a click of a button. Every day we are unlocking hidden potential in field service businesses globally, we look forward to seeing your business do the same.",0

1870,"1 Mission of Sustainability and 30+ Years of Research Experience - New Innovations on Agricultural Sand, Filter Pavement and Oil Sands Fracking. Sand: One element, three applications, a whole world of water conservation possibilities. No matter where you live, you have likely noticed a major change in the amount of water in your region. Perhaps more frequent deluges and droughts has stripped the precious topsoil in your area and farmers have resorted to using more and more fertilizers to achieve crop yields. Perhaps area farmers rely soley on irrigation water, causing tensions over regional water use. Rechsand, the leader in nanocoating technologies on sand, have an array of simple, efficient and elegant solutions to some of our most pressing problems. Sand, in its natural state is gas permeable and to an extent water permeable. Nanocoating is the process of precisely layering different resins over individual round grains of aeolian sand. Each Rechsand resin has certain characteristics, which allow the resin coated sand to completely repel water, attract oil, repel oil, and/or float in water depending on the exact application needed. Hydrophobic and super hydrophobic, for example, sands are particularly useful where one needs to separate water from other materials at the molecular level or to contain water, while allowing other substances and gases to pass. New Farming Frontiers – Agricultural Sand Water scarcity is food scarcity. Global climate change is altering the rainfall patterns on which all farmers around the world depend. Millions of people, particularly in developing countries, stare down climate change induced food scarcity every harvest season. The number of extreme climate-related disasters, including extreme heat, droughts, floods and storms, has doubled since the early 1990s. Disasters harm agricultural productivity of major crops such as wheat, rice and maize causing food price hikes and income losses that reduce people’s access to food. Droughts and desertification is destabilizing economies and threatening peace. Water management to counter climate change induced hunger is nothing less than war prevention. Rechsand Ag Sand holds the power to reverse food scarcity and perhaps prevent wars. When Rechsand water-saving sand is lined below plantings, up to 75% less irrigation water is required to achieve the same yields. Just imagine the new farming frontiers Rechsand Ag Sand presents. Layering a thin layer of hydrophobic agricultural sand is particularly effective for orchard planting, allowing, for example, farmers in arid climates can now plant the most water-thirsty and lucrative nut crops. Other liner systems under row crops are plastic based and can lead to plant asphyxiation. Row crops with a layer of Rechsand Ag Sand thrive with a fraction of water and fertilizer as less is lost to percolation while toxic gases still escape.  Rain is a resource (not a nuisance) Conversely, if you are not experiencing drought, perhaps you live at the other end of the extreme of the new global hydrological and you live with unprecedented heavy rainfall and flooding. Your town's sidewalks are a puddle-ridden obstacle course and cars careen through inches of standing water as sewer systems become overloaded. Every year, more businesses suffer property damage and people are injured. Snow and ice present tremendous hazards requiring municipalities to equip, staff and plan for events that cannot be reliably predicted.  Your situation is predicted to only get worse, year for year. For example, the National Academy of the Sciences predicts New York City will experience tropical storms like 2017's $70 billion Hurricane Sandy to occur every five years by 2030. Y Even then, when water and snow clears, public spaces are scarred by the filth and grime of black chewing gum dots and dirty engine oil stains. When the clouds clear for too long, that presents its own problem, as municipalities  Rechsand has simple, beautiful and effective solutions to turn urban rain into a resource, not a nuisance. Rainwater “disappears” straight through nanocoated sand Filter Pavers and standing water is a things of the past. Runoff water can be collected, stored in a nanocoated sand reservoir and used later, creating, in effect, a community’s very own managed hydrologic cycle.  Furthermore, Rechsand filter paving solutions are “self-cleaning”: Snow doesn’t stick to it, nor does chewing gum or engine oil. Plus, this velvety smooth paving material can be cast in any shape and dyed any color—it’s simply beautiful to look at. This nanocoated sand paving has been used on thousands of sites and withstood the test of time. Installations from 15 years ago look brand new. A New Age of Cleaner, More Productive Hydraulic Fracturing Or perhaps you are one of 13 million Americans, who lives within one mile of a fracking well. If that fracking operation is plagued with low conductivity and clogged fractures, that well is losing money and your soil and groundwater is threatened.  About 16% of hydraulically fractured wells spill liquids every year. Mitigating and containing frac liquid spills is imperative to everyone. Water use per frac well has increased by 770% from 2011 to 2016. Flowback and produced water from new wells increased by approximately 1,440% in this same time period as well. At the current rate, fracking's water use could grow 50-fold by the year 2030. Rechsand offers an array of sands depending on the downhole conditions to increase production and reduce fracking pollution. Rechsand proppants can coax 15-50% more oil from fractures, while reducing the threat of contamination to soil and water. It's a win-win, which quickly pays for itself. Rechsand proppants require little or no gelling agents, gum sugar or other chemical fluids to encourage conductivity. Rechsand proppants are also safer for workers to use and cause less wear and damage to equipment. Rechsand has proppants which either attract Visit Us Today…",0

Until PaySecure, the only way to use a debit card on the internet was as signature debit. Acculynk is the first company in the U.S. to offer a software-only service for internet PIN debit payments, PaySecureÂ®. Acculynkâ€™s technology platform utilizes a graphical, scrambling PIN-pad for the secure entry of sensitive cardholder information.  Unlike other authentication methods that require hardware, redirection or enrollment, PaySecure is unique in that it provides a simple consumer checkout experience that mimics the consumer experience using PIN debit at the grocery store. Acculynkâ€™s PIN debit solution is enabled for mobile and touch screen (iOS, Android, Blackberry).  Acculynk has leveraged its patents, technology and partnership advantages to deliver a debit-driven P2P solution that solves two key issues that have hampered adoption in the P2P space:  real time transfer of funds and enrollment. Acculynk currently has a 100MM cardholder base within the internet PIN debit network, 7000 debit card issuers and 3000+ online merchants. While PIN debit is used extensively at the retail POS, before PaySecure consumers have never been given the opportunity to use PIN debit online.  Since the introduction of PaySecure consumers have shown a clear preference for PIN debit online --  when the PaySecure PIN pad is displayed consumers choose to enter their PIN up to 70% of the time.  PIN debit drives merchant acceptance cost down due to lower fraud and chargebacks.  Post-Durbin, Issuers are abandoning signature debit for PIN debit based the higher profitability of PIN. The problem of securely and simply authenticating consumers is becoming more widespread as EMV, mobile and P2P become available to consumers.  Acculynkâ€™s patented authentication has a play in these markets as well. Backed by a powerful encryption and authentication technology platform protected by a family of issued and pending patents, Acculynkâ€™s services provide greater security, reliability and return on investment for merchants, issuers and EFT networks.",1

AMC will commercialise this data set in order to fund further development of the Asteroid Mining industry, using the revenues from the Space Resource Database to refocus our R&D on the extraction, processing and utilisation of the available extra-terrestrial materials. We are first and foremost a business. We aim to extract resources from asteroids to boost the Earth's economy and kick start the Space Based Economy as the vast values of some asteroids can be valued in trillions, with the largest asteroids being worth quintillions, while even small asteroids can be hugely valuable. This money will be spent in building ever growing amounts of space infrastructure so that we can eventually allow all humans who desire it to live and work in Space. The Asteroid Mining Corporation is also an ecologically minded, ethical company. We believe asteroid mining will greatly benefit the world environmentally, by moving industry into space so that in future the people of Earth can look upon our planet as the fragile and all important oasis of life in the Solar System. A home where all humanity can live in peace. Finally we aim to mine asteroids for something much more profound than merely profit. We are driven by a deep and life long obsession with space. It has been almost 50 years since man first set foot on the Moon, and in that time we haven't even been back. We want to allow every person on this planet the opportunity to visit, or even live and work in space if they so desire within the next fifty years. With fifty years of continuous economic exploitation of space we foresee that there will be an Asteroid Mining Corporation colony on Ceres by the time our CEO retires. This is our lifelong passion and ambition, and everyone at the Asteroid Mining Corporation has decided to devote their entire lives to something larger and infinitely more bold than most things in our current society. We want to contribute and directly spur the manned human exploration of Space. The technologies we are developing will allow us to supply colonies on Mars, to explore the Oceans of Europa and Enceladus to finally prove whether or not we are alone in the Solar System. Eventually mankind will leave our solar system and will go on the greatest adventure in human history, to explore and settle a distant star, so that our great-grandchildren will one day be able to look up at the stars from Earth and say, there are people like me up there. At this point we will have evolved into Homo Stellaris: the humans of the stars.  It is Asteroid Mining technologies that will unlock this final great stage of human evolution.",0
